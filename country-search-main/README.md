# Country-search
This is the assignment for Javascript Internship, which is given by [DeepThought](https://deepthought.education/dtselection).<br>
In this project I have to create a country searching web app, which can search different countries using different parameters.<br>
For completion of assignment, DT provides a rest countries API  to fetch all countries' details.<BR>
I find this API so interesting so I suggest this API for others also (Visit [Restcountries](https://restcountries.com/) and read documentation.)<br>
  
### Technology used
